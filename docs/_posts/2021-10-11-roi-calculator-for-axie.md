[**Axie Infinity**](https://axieinfinity.com/) is one of the hottest NFT game right now and it wasn't only for its cute oblong monsters but also one of the first play-to-earn games in Ethereum blockchain.

---

Playing the game requires at least 3 Axies and they come with a cost. As of this writing, the floor price for one Axie is **0.04 WETH ($142)** and three of them could worth **0.12 WETH ($426)**. However, most players went through scholarships first - this is the way new Axie players can play the game for free but only a portion of earned Small Love Potions tokens will be sent to the player and other to Manager.

Later, you'll be window shopping for floor or good Axies and want to find out how to calculate days to gain back what you've paid for using [**our ROI calculator**](https://frvfrvr.github.io/axie/axie)...

## Guide

If you do not own three Axies yet, you can go look for them and calculate the prices using our ROI calculator:

* In our [**Axie ROI Calculator**](https://frvfrvr.github.io/axie/axie), input their WETH prices and date you've purchased (or plan to purchase) the third Axie then fill the average SLP earned per day. If unsure, **70-75 SLP** is the minimum quota for most scholars and casual players.
